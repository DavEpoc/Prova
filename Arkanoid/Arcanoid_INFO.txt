the ball and the board can move,they have collisions and are restrained
into boundaries.

levels info for brick's health and color are parsed from
activeBrickGrid.txt and colorBrickGrid.txt

new random level is load if all bricks die or if r is pressed

game will end(close) if ball falls under board

i had some fun mixing colors and textures and making the board change texture
if crossing half width.
